        <h2>Case Studies</h2>
        <h3>Case Study 1: E-commerce Platform Migration</h3>
        <p>
          Our team successfully helped a leading e-commerce company migrate their legacy platform to a modern, scalable architecture. By utilizing Next.js for the frontend and AWS services like Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, we achieved significant improvements in performance, scalability, and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The migration enabled the client to handle high traffic volumes, scale their application dynamically, and deliver a seamless shopping experience to their customers. The improved infrastructure also contributed to increased conversion rates and revenue growth for the e-commerce business.
        </p>
        <h3>Case Study 2: Serverless Application Development</h3>
        <p>
          For a fast-growing startup, we developed a serverless application using Next.js AWS API Gateway, and AWS Lambda. By leveraging the event-driven architecture of serverless computing, we achieved high scalability, reduced operational costs, and rapid development cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application seamlessly handled spikes in traffic, ensuring a smooth user experience even during peak periods. The serverless approach allowed the client to focus on their core business logic while benefiting from the scalability and cost-efficiency of AWS Lambda. The solution helped the startup scale rapidly and achieve their business goals.
